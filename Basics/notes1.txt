python inner working
first code is compiled to byte code (low level & platform independent)
.byte code runs faster
.pyc complies python(frozen binary)
__pycache__ is a special folder that Python automatically creates to store compiled bytecode files for your .py source files.

when you import some function of other file in other so in that case
a __pycache__ folder create in that hello.cpyhton-version.pyc named bytecode genrate
but byte code files are genrated only for imported files not for top levels files

.....
PVM python virtual machine
it is called run time engine
also called python interpreter
It reads bytecode line-by-line, executes using a call stack, manages memory, handles exceptions, etc.
## byte code is not a machine code
