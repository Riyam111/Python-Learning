✅ Immutable Data Types
Once created, you cannot change their content. If you try, a new object is created.
Examples:
int – Integer
float – Floating-point numbers
bool – Boolean
str – String
tuple – Tuple
frozenset – Immutable set
bytes – Immutable byte array
eg=>username="Riya"
it will create a space where "Riya" is created
now if you created username="Maurya"
then it will create another space where "Maurya" is created
now if you print username you will get Maurya
but wait now you thought that here username value change then how you say that it is Immutable
let me explain , when you point username to new value then "Riya" is not change rather your username point to new varible and after 
some time global "Riya" space will cleanup but it will not change 

✅ Mutable Data Types
Their content can be changed after creation, without changing the object's identity.
Examples:
list – List
dict – Dictionary
set – Set
bytearray – Mutable byte array
user-defined classes (by default)
